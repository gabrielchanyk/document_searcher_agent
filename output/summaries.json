Large Language Models (LLMs) are an evolving field in AI, being developed by organizations like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. They are designed to improve accuracy in reasoning tasks, adapt to user preferences, and align with social values. The models undergo a rapid iteration and evolution process, with significant improvements in tasks such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, effective test-time scaling remains a challenging area for the research community. The models require relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training, making them a feasible solution for various applications.
